Pitagora Galaxy on Docker
=========================

Pitagora Galaxy is a project to distribute [galaxy](http://usegalaxy.org) environment shipped with pre-installed packages and workflow for NGS data analysis. We designed the virtual environment for wet-lab researchers to build their own environment without specific skills and knowledges to setup, maintain, or upgrade. Pitagora Galaxy is also working to encourage the activity of the galaxy user community in Japan to share experiences and workflows each other.
